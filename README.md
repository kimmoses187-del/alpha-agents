# K-AlphaAgents 🤖📈
### LLM Multi-Agent System for Korean Equity Research

A partial replication of **BlackRock's AlphaAgents** (Zhao et al., 2025) adapted for Korean equities (KOSPI/KOSDAQ).  
**Up to five specialized AI agents** collaborate, debate, and reach a consensus **BUY / SELL** recommendation under your chosen investor profile — **Risk-Averse**, **Risk-Neutral**, or both at once — then automatically construct a portfolio and backtest it. You pick how many agents debate (an **odd** number — 1, 3, or 5 — so the majority vote never ties) and which risk profile(s) to run.

## The Five Agents

The full roster is five agents. Each run uses an **odd-sized subset** of your choice (1, 3, or 5) so the majority vote always resolves; conviction weighting re-normalises over whichever agents you pick.

| Agent | Data Source | Analytical Lens |
|---|---|---|
| **FundamentalAgent** | OpenDART — stage-aware: 3 annual FYs + all interim reports (initial) / 1 annual + 1 interim (rebalancing) · **DART full filing documents** (MD&A, risk factors, business description) · **DCF + comps valuation** · **Naver analyst consensus** (target price, implied upside) | Revenue trends, margins, cash flow quality, debt, governance, intrinsic value vs market price |
| **SentimentAgent** | DART disclosure list · pykrx investor net flow · pykrx short selling | Corporate events, foreign/institutional accumulation vs distribution, bearish positioning |
| **TechnicalAgent** | pykrx price history — current quarter + prior quarter + KOSPI/KOSDAQ index | MA20/MA60, RSI, Bollinger Bands, relative performance vs benchmarks, QoQ delta |
| **MarketAgent** | DART KSIC sector (primary) · **pykrx dynamic peer detection** (live sector classifications) · pykrx benchmark returns · yfinance ratios (optional) | Industry cycle, competitive positioning, KOSPI/KOSDAQ benchmark comparison |
| **MacroAgent** | KRW/USD · KOSPI · KOSDAQ · S&P 500 · NASDAQ · US 10Y · Oil · Gold · **BoK ECOS** (base rate, CPI, industrial production, CD rate) | Currency impact, interest rate environment, Korea vs global capital flows, domestic monetary policy |

Each agent is independently role-prompted with the chosen risk profile and produces a standalone **BUY / SELL** recommendation before entering the debate phase.

---

## Risk Profile Framework

Each agent operates under one of two investor profiles, applied with a **two-step structure**:

**Step 1 — Objective data reading:**  
The agent reads and analyses all available data without filtering — every positive and negative signal is noted before any conclusion is formed.

**Step 2 — Risk-weighted judgment:**  
The agent applies the lens of its assigned profile when forming its final recommendation:

| Profile | Tie-break rule | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **Risk-Averse** | Risk wins | When risks and returns are of similar magnitude, the downside carries more weight → lean SELL |
| **Risk-Neutral** | Return wins | When risks and returns are of similar magnitude, the upside carries more weight → lean BUY |

This two-step approach ensures agents always consider the full picture before applying their profile weighting — avoiding the trap of selectively reading only bearish (or only bullish) signals.

**Profiles are selectable per run.** At the start of a New Analysis you choose **Risk-Averse only**, **Risk-Neutral only**, or **Both** (default). A single-profile run produces one debate per stock, one portfolio, one backtest, and a single-column report — at roughly half the LLM debate cost. When both are selected they run **simultaneously** via `ThreadPoolExecutor` — data is fetched once and shared. Everything downstream (portfolio, backtest, report, exports) adapts to whichever profile(s) you picked.

---

## Debate Mechanism

```
Round 0 — Independent Analysis  (Steelman enforced)
  The selected agents (odd count: 1/3/5) analyse in isolation → each issues BUY or SELL
  Each agent must argue the strongest opposing case before concluding
  If all selected agents agree → TERMINATE  (unanimous, 0 debate rounds)

Rounds 1–3 — Structured Debate  (Active challenge enforced)
  Each agent reads all of its peers' analyses
  Must cite specific conflicting claims and explain why they are wrong
  Explicitly states: MAINTAINING or CHANGING position, and why
  After each round: if all selected agents agree → TERMINATE  (unanimous)

After Round 3 — Majority Vote
  Strict majority wins. The agent count is forced ODD (1/3/5) so a binary
  BUY/SELL vote can never tie (e.g. with 5: 5-0, 4-1, or 3-2).
```

---

## Convergence Scoring

Convergence is computed using a weighted vote combined with a round-speed bonus:

```
convergence = (weighted_vote × 0.6) + (round_score × 0.4)

weighted_vote : share of agent weight held by agents agreeing with the final
                signal (re-normalised over the agents that ran, so a 3-agent
                unanimous vote still scores a full 1.0)
round_score   : 1.0 at round 0 (instant consensus), decays to 0.0 at round 3
```

Agents are weighted by how directly their data connects to the firm being analysed. All five agents now have substantial data inputs, so the original data-hardness ordering (Fundamental > Technical > Macro > Market > Sentiment) no longer reflects meaningful differences in data quality. Instead, weights are set by **data connectedness**:

- **Direct agents** use data that is specific to the company (financial statements, corporate disclosures, investor flows, the stock's own price history).
- **Indirect agents** use contextual data that surrounds the company (sector dynamics, macro environment) but is not company-specific.

| Group | Agents | Each weight | Group total |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Direct** (company-specific data) | FundamentalAgent · SentimentAgent · TechnicalAgent | 0.2167 | 65% |
| **Indirect** (sector / macro context) | MacroAgent · MarketAgent | 0.1750 | 35% |

Each direct agent individually outweighs each indirect agent (0.2167 > 0.1750). Weights are normalised to sum to exactly 1.0.

---

## Portfolio Construction

After all stocks are analysed, the **PortfolioAgent** constructs one portfolio per selected risk profile (one if you chose a single profile, two if you chose Both):

- **SELL** stocks receive 0% weight and are excluded from the portfolio
- **BUY** stocks are included regardless of convergence score
- Weight is distributed **convergence-proportionally** across all BUY stocks, summing to 100%
- Portfolios are signal-only — no fixed equity/bond split or stop-loss rules

---

## Backtesting

`BacktestEngine` fetches KRX prices via `pykrx` and computes:

- **Cumulative Return** — portfolio vs. two benchmarks
- **Rolling Sharpe Ratio** — 30-trading-day window (x-axis anchored to start date; warm-up period left blank)

**Benchmarks overlaid on every chart:**
1. **EW Benchmark** — equal-weight of all analysed stocks regardless of signal (orange)
2. **KOSPI** — fetched via pykrx (green)
3. **KOSDAQ** — fetched via pykrx (purple)

Backtesting is skipped automatically if no stocks receive a BUY signal in any selected profile.

## Recent Enhancements (2026-05-28)

Nine data-enrichment and output improvements were shipped in one batch. Summary of what was added:

| # | Enhancement | Files |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **DART full filing documents** — MD&A, risk factors, business narrative, outlook; ~8 K tokens per stock | `tools/dart_document_tools.py` |
| 2 | **DCF + comps valuation** — 5-year DCF (WACC 10%, terminal 2%) with Bear/Base/Bull; peer P/E and P/B table; reuses already-fetched DART data | `tools/valuation_tools.py` |
| 4 | **Dynamic peer detection** — live pykrx sector classifications replace the hardcoded peer list | `tools/market_tools.py` |
| 5 | **BoK ECOS macro data + dynamic risk-free rate** — base rate, CPI, industrial production, 91-day CD rate; CD rate feeds Sharpe calculation in BacktestEngine | `tools/macro_tools.py` · `backtest/engine.py` · `config.py` |
| 6 | **Calibration charts** — `agent_accuracy.png` (bar chart with baseline and target lines) + `signal_outcomes.png` (avg return on BUY vs SELL); dark-themed, saved alongside `calibration.json` | `calibration/visualizer.py` · `calibration/builder.py` |
| 7 | **Excel + Word export** — `portfolio_{date}.xlsx` (3-sheet portfolio summary + backtest + signal detail) and `report_{date}.docx` (all MD reports bundled) | `report/exporters.py` |
| 8 | **Naver Finance analyst consensus** — scrapes target price and analyst count; computes implied upside/downside; appended to FundamentalAgent context | `tools/naver_tools.py` |
| 11 | **PDF brand refresh + calibration chart page** — brand colors updated to navy/gold/BUY-green/SELL-red; if calibration charts exist a third page is appended to the executive summary PDF | `report/summary_renderer.py` |

---

## Output Files

`reports/` is split into three clean subtrees — **signals** (all LLM outputs, always reloadable), **backtest** (PDFs and result files), and **calibration** (per-agent signal accuracy history):

```
reports/
├── signals/
│   └── {ticker}_{name}/               ← one folder per company (Q1, Q2, Q3 all here)
│       └── {as_of_date}/              ← data cutoff date — one per quarter analysed
│           ├── averse/                  ← only if Risk-Averse was selected
│           │   └── {ticker}_{name}_{as-of}_averse.md
│           ├── neutral/                 ← only if Risk-Neutral was selected
│           │   └── {ticker}_{name}_{as-of}_neutral.md
│           └── {ticker}_{name}_{as-of}.json   ← signals for the selected profile(s)
│
├── backtest/
│   └── {run_date}/                    ← date the backtest was executed
│       └── {as_of_date}/
│           ├── buy_and_hold/
│           │   └── Exec_Sum_{as-of}.pdf         ← Executive Summary PDF
│           └── rebalance/                        ← only present if rebalancing was run
│               ├── Rebalanced_{as-of}.json       ← full weight schedule + quarterly log
│               └── Exec_Sum_Rebalanced_{as-of}.pdf
│
└── calibration/
    └── {signal_as_of_date}/           ← the quarter whose signals are being calibrated
        ├── calibration.json           ← per-agent signal accuracy history (auto-loaded on next run)
        ├── agent_accuracy.png         ← bar chart: per-agent accuracy vs 50% baseline / 65% target
        └── signal_outcomes.png        ← avg return on BUY vs SELL per agent
```

**Q1, Q2, Q3 signals all land in `signals/{ticker}/{as_of_date}/`** — there is no separate quarterly subfolder.  
Each quarterly as-of date (e.g. `2025-06-01`, `2025-09-01`, `2025-12-01`) gets its own date folder under the company.

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `signals/…/*_neutral.md` | Full agent analyses + debate log — Risk-Neutral profile |
| `signals/…/*_averse.md` | Full agent analyses + debate log — Risk-Averse profile |
| `signals/…/*.json` | Structured signals for the selected profile(s) — auto-created after every run |
| `backtest/…/Exec_Sum_*.pdf` | 2–3 page institutional PDF (buy-and-hold backtest); page 3 = calibration charts if available |
| `backtest/…/Exec_Sum_Rebalanced_*.pdf` | 2–3 page institutional PDF (rebalancing backtest) |
| `backtest/…/Rebalanced_*.json` | Saved weight schedule + quarterly log for future reload |
| `backtest/…/portfolio_{date}.xlsx` | 3-sheet Excel: Portfolio Summary · Backtest Summary · Signal Details |
| `backtest/…/report_{date}.docx` | All per-stock MD reports bundled into a single Word document |
| `calibration/…/calibration.json` | Per-agent signal accuracy history — auto-loaded at the start of the next analysis |
| `calibration/…/agent_accuracy.png` | Bar chart: per-agent BUY/SELL accuracy vs 50% baseline and 65% target |
| `calibration/…/signal_outcomes.png` | Grouped bar chart: avg return on BUY signals vs avg return on SELL signals |

Signal JSON files are created automatically after every `[N] New Analysis` run — no manual conversion step is required.

### Calibration Files

`calibration/{signal_as_of_date}/calibration.json` is generated automatically the next time a new analysis is run after a holding period has ended. It records what each of the five agents predicted for the previous quarter, what actually happened, and pre-formats that history per agent for injection into the next debate.

**Load rule:** at the start of every new analysis, the system checks for existing calibration files covering the same stock pool. If found, they are loaded directly (no regeneration, no extra API call). If missing or the stock pool has changed, they are generated fresh and saved for future runs.

**Cold start:** on the very first run there is no calibration history — the system proceeds without it and behavior is identical to today. Calibration activates automatically from the second quarter onwards.

### Executive Summary PDF

Built with **reportlab** — institutional navy (`#0D1117`) / gold (`#F0B429`) design, BUY badges in green (`#2EA043`), SELL badges in red (`#F85149`), Korean font support.

| Page | Sections |
|---|---|
| Page 1 | §1 Stock Signals & Convergence table · §2 Portfolio Allocation cards + donut pie charts |
| Page 2 | §3 Investment Narrative (Claude-written; cross-profile when both are selected) · §4 Portfolio Metrics at a Glance · §5 Backtest Results chart |
| Page 3 *(optional)* | Calibration Charts — agent accuracy bars + signal return outcomes; only appended if `calibration/` charts exist |

## Usage

```bash
run
```

#### [N] New Analysis

```
  [N] New analysis        — fetch data, run agents, save signals
  [L] Load saved signals  — skip analysis, go straight to portfolio & backtest

  Choice (N / L): N

  Enter analysis date (YYYY/MM/DD) — all stocks will be analysed using data prior to this date: 2025/06/01

  Stock #1
  Enter stock ticker (e.g. 005930): 005930
  → Looking up company on OpenDART...
  → Confirmed: 삼성전자(주)  (005930)

  ...

  Which risk profile(s) would you like to analyse?
    [1] Risk-Averse only
    [2] Risk-Neutral only
    [3] Both  (default)
  Choice (1–3) [default 3]: 3

  Which agents should debate this pool?
    [1] Fundamental   [2] Sentiment   [3] Technical   [4] Market   [5] Macro
    [A] All five  (default)
  Pick an ODD number of agents (1, 3, or 5) so the vote can't tie.
  Enter agent numbers (e.g. 1,3,5) or A [default A]: A

  → [1/2] Fetching data...
  → [2/2] Running debates (2 profiles in parallel)...
  → [RISK-AVERSE  ] BUY   convergence=0.920  (unanimous, 0 round(s))

## Research Experiments

Because the run parameters are now first-class (selectable profiles and agents),
you can compare conditions systematically with a thin experiment harness in
`experiments/`. It **drives** the existing pipeline from the outside — the main
analyze → portfolio → backtest → report flow is untouched.

**Build a recipe** (a guided Q&A that writes a YAML design file):

```
run experiment
```

It asks for the stock pool, as-of date, risk profile(s), repeats, and the
**setups to compare** (each an odd-sized agent subset), then saves
`experiments/recipes/<name>.yaml`:

```yaml
name: macro-ablation
question: Does removing the Macro agent change results?
stocks: ["005930", "000660"]
as_of: 2025/06/01
profiles: [risk-neutral]
repeats: 5                         # the debate is an LLM and varies → average over repeats
conditions:
  - name: all-five
    agents: [FundamentalAgent, SentimentAgent, TechnicalAgent, MarketAgent, MacroAgent]
  - name: no-macro
    agents: [FundamentalAgent, SentimentAgent, TechnicalAgent]
```

You can also copy `experiments/recipes/_template.yaml` and edit it by hand.
Agent counts are forced **odd** (1/3/5) so the majority vote can't tie, and the
recipe is the *design* — written down before the run so results are reproducible.

**Run a recipe:**

```
DEBUG_MODE=true run experiment macro-ablation   # free dry-run (stubbed LLM)
run experiment macro-ablation                   # real run (confirms cost first)
```

For each stock the runner fetches data once, then runs the debate once per
*(condition × repeat)* — the LLM debate is the stochastic part, which is what
`repeats` samples. It writes one results CSV (no per-run report files) with full
provenance (`signal, conviction, agents, model, git_sha, run_ts, …`) and prints
an averaged summary (BUY rate, mean conviction, ± std):

```
  condition     profile        BUY rate  avg conv   ± std
  all-five      Risk-Neutral       80%      0.90    0.04
  no-macro      Risk-Neutral       50%      0.67    0.12
```

Results land in `experiments/results/<name>_<date>.csv`. See `experiments/README.md`.

## LLM Architecture

| Role | Model | Provider |
|---|---|---|
| Primary (all agents + narrative) | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Anthropic |
| Fallback (auto, per agent) | `gpt-4o` | OpenAI |

- If a Claude API call fails for any agent, the system transparently retries with GPT-4o
- Each agent operates independently — no shared memory or state within a round
- Debate context is passed as explicit text, preserving full transparency

### Prompt Caching

All LLM calls use Anthropic's **prompt caching** to reduce token costs:

| Cached content | Savings |
|---|---|
| **Tier 1** — Agent system prompt + debate instructions (steelman / challenge) | ~90% cheaper from Round 1 onwards |
| **Tier 2** — Agent's data blob (DART financials, pykrx metrics, etc.) | ~90% cheaper from Round 1 onwards |

Per stock (agents selected × profiles selected × up to 4 rounds — e.g. 40 calls for 5 agents × both profiles, 12 for 3 agents × one profile): only Round 0 pays full price for system prompts and data. Rounds 1–3 hit cache. Choosing fewer agents and/or one profile cuts the debate call count proportionally.

### Run Modes

```bash
# Full quality — for actual investment decisions
run

# Pipeline testing — zero token cost, stub BUY responses
DEBUG_MODE=true run

# Real analysis at ~20x lower cost — for development/debugging
CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5 run
```

## Render Deployment

The web UI is hosted on Render at **https://alpha-agents-su4l.onrender.com**.

### How it works

- **Runtime:** Python 3 web service (`python3 web/app.py`)
- **Build command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` (no system-level installs needed)
- **Korean font:** `fonts/NanumGothic.ttf` is bundled in the repository — `report/summary_renderer.py` checks this path first, so no `apt-get` is required during build
- **SocketIO server:** runs with `allow_unsafe_werkzeug=True` (Render free tier uses Werkzeug, not gunicorn/eventlet)
- **Free tier:** the instance spins down after 15 min of inactivity; first request after spin-down may take ~50 s to respond
- **Persistent storage:** the free plan does not mount a persistent disk, so `reports/` is ephemeral across restarts. Upgrade to the Starter plan and uncomment the `disk:` block in `render.yaml` to keep generated PDFs and signal JSONs across deploys

### Environment variables

Set these in the Render dashboard (Settings → Environment):

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | ✅ | Claude API key |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | ✅ | OpenAI fallback key |
| `DART_API_KEY` | ✅ | OpenDART API key |
| `BOK_API_KEY` | optional | BoK ECOS API key — enables live Korean macro indicators |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | optional | Override the default model (e.g. `claude-haiku-4-5`) |
| `DEBUG_MODE` | optional | Set `true` to run without LLM calls (stub responses) |

### Re-deploying

Push to `main` — auto-deploy is enabled. To force a clean rebuild:

```
Render dashboard → alpha-agents → Manual Deploy → Clear build cache & deploy
```

## Limitations

- **KRX login warning:** pykrx prints a login warning on startup — this is cosmetic and does not affect data fetching. Public market data works without credentials.
- **Financial data lag:** OpenDART financials reflect the most recently filed report based on Korea's actual filing calendar. For dates before key deadlines (Mar 31 / May 15 / Aug 14 / Nov 14), earlier reports are used.
- **Dynamic peer detection:** pykrx `get_market_sector_classifications()` uses KRX sector labels which may differ from DART KSIC codes. If the live lookup fails, the system falls back to the hardcoded `KOREAN_SECTOR_PEERS` table.
- **DART full documents:** Annual and semi-annual reports are available as downloadable ZIPs. Not all filings contain every section (e.g., outlook or MD&A). Missing sections are skipped gracefully and the document context is left empty rather than raising an error.
- **Naver Finance scraping:** Target prices are scraped from the public Naver Finance page and may be absent for thinly covered stocks. Scraping fails silently — FundamentalAgent proceeds without consensus data.
- **DCF valuation:** The DCF model uses simplified assumptions (WACC 10%, terminal growth 2%, 5-year window). It is intended as a relative anchor, not a precise fair-value estimate.
- **BoK ECOS lag:** BoK series are published with a 1–2 month lag. The most recent available data point is used; the series date is shown in the macro context.
- **yfinance ratios:** P/E and P/B ratios from yfinance are optional enrichment — many Korean stocks return N/A. Core analysis does not depend on them.
- **LLM outputs:** Despite the multi-agent debate mechanism (which demonstrably reduces hallucination — Du et al., 2023), all outputs should be treated as research assistance, not financial advice.
