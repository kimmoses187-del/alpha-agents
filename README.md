# K-AlphaAgents 🤖📈
### LLM Multi-Agent System for Korean Equity Research

A partial replication of **BlackRock's AlphaAgents** (Zhao et al., 2025) adapted for Korean equities (KOSPI/KOSDAQ).  
**Five specialized AI agents** collaborate, debate, and reach a consensus **BUY / SELL** recommendation — simultaneously under both **Risk-Averse** and **Risk-Neutral** investor profiles — then automatically construct a portfolio and backtest it.

## The Five Agents

| Agent | Data Source | Analytical Lens |
|---|---|---|
| **FundamentalAgent** | OpenDART (사업보고서 / 분기보고서) | Revenue trends, margins, cash flow quality, debt, governance |
| **SentimentAgent** | yfinance news feed | News sentiment, analyst rating changes, insider signals |
| **ValuationAgent** | yfinance price & volume (3-month window) | Price momentum, annualised return & volatility, volume confirmation |
| **MarketAgent** | yfinance sector info + Korean peer tickers | Industry cycle, competitive positioning, peer valuation vs KOSPI |
| **MacroAgent** | KRW/USD · KOSPI · KOSDAQ · S&P 500 · NASDAQ · US 10Y · Oil · Gold | Currency impact, interest rate environment, Korea vs global capital flows |

Each agent is independently role-prompted with the chosen risk profile and produces a standalone **BUY / SELL** recommendation before entering the debate phase.

---

## Debate Mechanism

```
Round 0 — Independent Analysis  (Steelman enforced)
  All 5 agents analyse in isolation → each issues BUY or SELL
  Each agent must argue the strongest opposing case before concluding
  If all 5 agree → TERMINATE  (unanimous, 0 debate rounds)

Rounds 1–3 — Structured Debate  (Active challenge enforced)
  Each agent reads all 4 peers' analyses
  Must cite specific conflicting claims and explain why they are wrong
  Explicitly states: MAINTAINING or CHANGING position, and why
  After each round: if all 5 agree → TERMINATE  (unanimous)

After Round 3 — Majority Vote
  3-of-5 wins  (5-0, 4-1, or 3-2 — no tie possible)
```

Both risk profiles run **simultaneously** via `ThreadPoolExecutor` — data is fetched once and shared, halving wall-clock time.

---

## Conviction Scoring

Conviction is computed using **Option B — Agent Expertise Weighting**:

```
conviction = (weighted_vote × 0.6) + (round_score × 0.4)

weighted_vote : sum of agent weights for agents agreeing with final signal
round_score   : 1.0 at round 0 (instant consensus), decays to 0.0 at round 3
```

| Agent | Weight | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| FundamentalAgent | 0.30 | Hardest quantitative data |
| ValuationAgent | 0.25 | Direct price-signal evidence |
| MacroAgent | 0.20 | Structural macro context |
| MarketAgent | 0.15 | Industry positioning |
| SentimentAgent | 0.10 | Softest / most noisy signal |

---

## Portfolio Construction

After all stocks are analysed, the **PortfolioAgent** constructs two separate portfolios:

| Parameter | Risk-Averse | Risk-Neutral |
|---|---|---|
| Equity allocation | 60% | 80% |
| Bond allocation (KODEX 국고채3년 · 114260) | 40% | 20% |
| Stop-loss | −5% | −10% |
| Take-profit | +10% | +20% |

- Stocks with a **SELL** signal receive **0% weight**
- All **BUY** stocks qualify for equity allocation regardless of conviction score
- Equity weight is distributed **conviction-proportionally** across qualifying stocks
- Remaining weight goes to the Korean 3Y Government Bond ETF

---

## Backtesting

`BacktestEngine` fetches KRX prices via `pykrx` and computes:

- **Cumulative Return** — portfolio vs. two benchmarks
- **Rolling Sharpe Ratio** — 30-trading-day window (x-axis anchored to start date; warm-up period left blank)

**Benchmarks overlaid on every chart:**
1. **EW Benchmark** — equal-weight of all analysed stocks regardless of signal (orange)
2. **KOSPI** — `^KS11` fetched via yfinance (green)
3. **KOSDAQ** — `^KQ11` fetched via yfinance (purple)

Backtesting is skipped automatically if no stocks qualify for equity allocation in either profile.

---

## Output Files

All outputs are saved to `reports/` with a consistent naming scheme:

| File | Naming | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| MD report (per stock × profile) | `{ticker}_{name}_{as-of}_{averse\|neutral}.md` | Full agent analyses, debate log, signal summary |
| Signal JSON (per stock) | `{ticker}_{name}_{as-of}_signals.json` | Structured signals for reloading without re-analysis |
| Executive Summary PDF | `Exec Sum_{as-of}.pdf` | 2-page institutional PDF (see below) |

### Executive Summary PDF

Built with **reportlab** — institutional navy/gold design, Korean font support.

| Page | Sections |
|---|---|
| Page 1 | §1 Stock Signals & Conviction table · §2 Portfolio Allocation cards + donut pie charts |
| Page 2 | §3 Cross-Profile Narrative (Claude-written) · §4 Portfolio Metrics at a Glance · §5 Backtest Results chart |

  Enter stock ticker (e.g. 005930): 214150
  → Looking up company on OpenDART...
  → Confirmed: (주)클래시스  (214150)
  → [1/2] Fetching data...
  → [2/2] Running debates (both profiles in parallel)...
  → [RISK-AVERSE  ] BUY   conviction=0.920  (unanimous, 0 round(s))
  → [RISK-NEUTRAL ] BUY   conviction=0.880  (unanimous, 0 round(s))

  Add another stock to the pool? (Y/N): Y
  ...

  Automatically starting backtest...
  Enter backtest end date (YYYY/MM/DD) [must be after 2025-06-01]: 2026/01/01

  Generating executive summary PDF...
  [PDF] Saved → reports/Exec Sum_2025-06-01.pdf
```

### [L] Load Saved Signals

Skip the full analysis and go straight to portfolio construction and backtesting using previously saved `_signals.json` files:

```
  Choice (N / L / C): L

  Saved signal files (5 found):
  [ 1] 086900  (주)메디톡스  (as_of 2025-06-01)
  [ 2] 145020  휴젤(주)      (as_of 2025-06-01)
  ...

  Enter file numbers to load (e.g. 1  or  1,3,4): 1,2,3,4,5
```

### [C] Convert MD Reports

If you have existing `.md` reports from before the signal JSON feature was added, convert them without re-running the analysis:

```
  Choice (N / L / C): C

  Found 5 convertible MD report pair(s):
  [ 1] 086900  (주)메디톡스  (data as-of: 2025-06-01)
  ...

  Convert all? (A) or enter numbers (e.g. 1,3): A
  → Converted: 086900 → reports/086900_메디톡스_2025-06-01_signals.json
```

### Example tickers

| Ticker | Company | Sector |
|---|---|---|
| `005930` | 삼성전자 (Samsung Electronics) | Technology |
| `000660` | SK하이닉스 (SK Hynix) | Technology |

## LLM Architecture

| Role | Model | Provider |
|---|---|---|
| Primary (all agents + narrative) | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Anthropic |
| Fallback (auto, per agent) | `gpt-4o` | OpenAI |

- If a Claude API call fails for any agent, the system transparently retries with GPT-4o
- Each agent operates independently — no shared memory or state within a round
- Debate context is passed as explicit text, preserving full transparency

---

## Macro Indicators Tracked

| Indicator | Ticker | Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| USD/KRW | `KRW=X` | Weaker KRW boosts export revenues |
| KOSPI | `^KS11` | Korean large-cap benchmark |
| KOSDAQ | `^KQ11` | Korean tech/growth benchmark |
| S&P 500 | `^GSPC` | Global risk appetite |
| NASDAQ | `^IXIC` | Tech-sector correlation |
| US 10Y Treasury | `^TNX` | EM capital flow pressure |
| Gold | `GC=F` | Safe-haven demand |
| Crude Oil (WTI) | `CL=F` | Input cost / geopolitical proxy |

---

## Key Formulas

**Annualised Cumulative Return**

$$R_{\text{annualized}} = \left(1 + R_{\text{cumulative}}\right)^{\frac{252}{n}} - 1$$

**Annualised Volatility**

$$\sigma_{\text{annualized}} = \sigma_{\text{daily}} \times \sqrt{252}$$

**Conviction Score**

$$\text{conviction} = \left(\sum_{i \in \text{agree}} w_i\right) \times 0.6 + \left(1 - \frac{r}{R_{\max}}\right) \times 0.4$$

where $w_i$ = agent weight, $r$ = rounds taken, $R_{\max}$ = 3.

---

## Limitations

- **News coverage:** yfinance news is sparse for smaller KOSPI/KOSDAQ stocks. The SentimentAgent may receive limited data for mid/small-cap names.
- **Financial data lag:** OpenDART financials reflect the most recently filed annual report — typically the prior completed fiscal year.
- **KRX login warning:** pykrx prints a login warning on startup — this is cosmetic and does not affect data fetching.
- **Peer mapping:** Sector peer tickers are predefined for major Korean sectors. Niche or cross-sector companies may lack ideal comparisons.
- **LLM outputs:** Despite the multi-agent debate mechanism (which demonstrably reduces hallucination — Du et al., 2023), all outputs should be treated as research assistance, not financial advice.
