## [2026-05-03] — Remove min conviction threshold

- All BUY stocks now qualify for equity allocation regardless of conviction score
- Conviction score is still computed and still drives conviction-proportional weighting — just no longer used as an entry gate

- Updated orchestrator console output and README accordingly

---

## [2026-05-02] — Backtest and PDF fixes

- Fixed `NameError: name 'stock_tag' is not defined` in orchestrator finalize

- Added `Data As-Of` field to all MD report headers
- Backtest chart redesigned: all solid lines, legends on every subplot, x-axis anchored to start date, rolling Sharpe warm-up period left blank
- Removed Stop-loss and Take-profit from PDF Portfolio Allocation and Metrics sections

## [2026-05-02] — File naming and reportlab PDF

- Output file naming changed to `{ticker}_{corp name}_{as-of date}` for MD/JSON and `Exec Sum_{as-of date}` for PDF

- Replaced matplotlib-based PDF with institutional reportlab design (navy/gold, Korean font support)
- Page 1: Signal table (BUY/SELL badges, RA/RN columns) + Portfolio allocation cards + Donut pie charts
- Page 2: LLM cross-profile narrative + Portfolio metrics + Backtest chart
